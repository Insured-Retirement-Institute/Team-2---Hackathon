# AI Inforce Management

## Topic

**AI Inforce Management - Team 2**

## Issue

Managing in-force annuities is fragmented, manual, and compliance-heavy.

- Advisors pull data from multiple carrier systems and formats, creating inefficiency.
- Missed opportunities for replacements, reallocations, or income elections lead to suboptimal client outcomes.
- Compliance reviews and documentation are inconsistent, increasing regulatory risk.
- Carriers face high service volume and manual validation effort.

## Measures of Success

- **Unified advisor dashboard** to view opportunities and take action.
- **50% reduction** in time to identify opportunities.
- **30% reduction** in carrier service interactions through automated processing.

## Get started

This repository supports the **AI Inforce Management** initiative. We are currently in the process of standing up [SwaggerHub](https://wwww.swaggerhub.com) to host OpenAPI definitions for unified advisor dashboards, carrier data integration, and opportunity identification. More to come.

Please refer to the [style guide](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Style-Guide) for technical governance of standards, data dictionary, and the code of conduct.

## Business Case

In-force annuity management today is fragmented, manual, and compliance-heavy. Advisors pull data from multiple carrier systems and formats, leading to inefficiency, missed opportunities (replacements, reallocations, income elections), and suboptimal client outcomes. Inconsistent compliance reviews and documentation increase regulatory risk, and carriers bear high service volume and manual validation effort.

A unified, AI-enabled approach addresses these issues by providing a single advisor dashboard to view opportunities and take action, targeting a **50% reduction** in time to identify opportunities and a **30% reduction** in carrier service interactions through automated processing. This specification defines the technical and governance foundations to achieve those measures of success.

## User Stories, personna - supporting documents for the business case

**Personas**

- **Advisor:** Financial professional who manages in-force annuities across multiple carriers and needs a single place to see opportunities and act on them without manual data gathering.
- **Carrier:** Insurer or product provider that wants to reduce service volume and manual validation while maintaining compliance and supporting advisor effectiveness.

**User stories**

- As an advisor, I want a unified dashboard so that I can view replacement, reallocation, and income-election opportunities across carriers in one place.
- As an advisor, I want to take action from that dashboard so that I can serve clients better without switching systems or formats.
- As an advisor, I want automated, consistent compliance documentation so that my reviews are thorough and my regulatory risk is lower.
- As a carrier, I want automated processing and validation so that service interactions and manual effort are reduced while remaining compliant.
- As a carrier, I want normalized data and clear APIs so that advisors can integrate our in-force data into their workflow efficiently.
