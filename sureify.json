    "description": "The Sureify CoreCONNECT Edge API is a collection of OpenAPI-compliant endpoints that allow various business personas — including policyowners, agents, advisors, back office users, and home office users — to interact programmatically with a life insurance or annuity carrier. \n   \n# Edge API Overview \nThe following sections discuss fundamental principles shared across all Edge endpoints.   \n\n## Client Compatibility\nThe Edge API is designed to be client-agnostic. Any system can use this set of endpoints to access life insurance carrier data (subject to authorization) and interact with business processes over that data.\n\nCommon clients include web applications, mobile native applications, hybrid/PWAs, and headless downstream service providers & distribution partners.\n\nSureify also offers two digital web applications built specifically against these Edge APIs: [LifetimeAGENT] (https://www.sureify.com/lifetimeagent/ ) and [LifetimeSERVICE] (https://www.sureify.com/lifetimeservice/).\n\n## Authentication & Authorization\n\n### Authentication\nAll CoreCONNECT Edge APIs require the requesting client to provide a valid Sureify access token obtained from the Sureify Identify Provider (IDP). \n\nThe Sureify access token must be placed in the authorization header of every HTTP request. The Sureify access token is obtained via standard OAuth authorization flows.\n\nMultiple flows are supported to meet the needs of various client types:\n- *Frontend Clients* (e.g. web/browser/mobile)\n  - Frontend clients acting on behalf of a logged-in user should use the Open ID Connect (OIDC) Code Authorization Grant Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to obtain an *ID token*, *access token*, and optional *refresh token*: \n    - The *ID token* provides basic information about the logged in user.\n    - The *access token* must be included with all Edge API requests.\n    - The *refresh token* enables the client to obtain new access tokens for some period of time without requiring the user to re-authenticate.\n  - Since these types of tokens are associated with a logged-in user, the Edge APIs perform authorization on behalf of the user.  More details on authorization are provided in the sections below.\n- *Backend Clients* (e.g. machine-to-machine requests)\n  - Backend clients use the OAuth Client Credential Grant Flow to obtain an access token for making machine-to-machine API requests. \n  - Since these types of tokens are not associated with a user, the API authorization mechanism requires the requesting client to specify a user identifier for authorization. More details on authorization are provided in the sections below.\n\nWe also support federating with the carrier’s Identity Provider (IDP) to enable users to login to the Frontend Client with their own carrier credentials.\n\nFor carriers using LifetimeSERVICE and LifetimeAGENT Frontend Clients, Edge API authentication/authorization is handled automatically.\n\n### Authorization\nAll CoreCONNECT Edge API responses include _only_ the data that is authorized to the requesting user.\n\nHowever, as mentioned in the *Authentication section* above, the user associated with the API request is identified differently depending on whether the client making the API request is a Frontend Client or a Backend Client.\n\n  - For Frontend Clients, the user’s identity is determined directly from the access token (as this token was obtained on behalf of the user via OIDC).\n\n  - For Backend Clients, the user’s identity is provided via a header within the API request.\n  \n  > **NOTE**: \n    > Since Backend Clients can make requests on behalf of any user, it is critical that the credentials and tokens associated with these clients are protected and always kept secure within the carrier’s trusted infrastructure. \n  > \n  > Backend Clients are expected to be trusted machines that receive authenticated requests from Frontend Clients, then proxy the request, on the user’s behalf, to the CoreCONNECT Edge APIs.\n  \n\nData returned from Edge API responses can further be filtered by various query parameters described in the *Filtering on Persona* and Filtering on Keycard* sections.\n\n### Keycards\n  Keycards are designed to provide access to a specific set of data, just as a physical building access keycard grants access to specific rooms. A keycard typically maps to a single agent/contract identifier, but can also map to a higher level agency or distribution partner such as an Independent Marketing Organization (IMO) or Brokerage General Agency (BGA).\n\nWhen a keycard identifies a contract/agent, it provides access to the data authorized to that particular agent. \nWhen the keycard identifies an agency or distribution partner, it provides access to all the data authorized to that particular agency (which may include all downline data).\n\nUsers that have multiple agent/contract identifiers are authorized to use multiple keycards, which can be obtained from the [/keycards endpoint](#/paths/~1puddle~1keycards/get).\n\nUsers can also be authorized to access other users’ keycards. For example, a head producers might have access to the keycards of all agents in their agency. Likewise, home office users might have access to the keycards of all the agents for the entire carrier. See the section *Filtering on Keycard* for more information.\n\n## Nulls and Representing Non-Existence \n\nWe don’t send nulls in Read response bodies. For example: if an endpoint can return ten fields, but six of those fields hold null values, we will only send four fields in the response.\n\nTo represent non-existence of sub-objects within a collection (e.g. elements within an array) we respond with an empty collection (e.g. an empty array).\n\n## Identifiers\nWe have two major types of identifiers in the Edge APIS:\n  - Sureify IDs (property names use the suffix  _ID_)\n  - Industry IDs (property names use the suffix  _Code_ or _Number_)\n\n### Sureify IDs\nProperties that include the suffix _ID_ (e.g. ID, policyID, agentID, documentID) refer to the unique solution-domain identifier that Sureify has assigned to each entity (whether that entity is a person, a company, a policy, etc).  We also use Sureify IDs to identify Workflow and Journey Instances.\n\nWe expose these Sureify IDs for the purpose of matching entities in our internal system to their corresponding records in external systems, such as carrier SORs.\n\n> **NOTE**: Although the value of a Sureify ID MAY appear to be a UUID, you MUST accept values that are not UUIDs.\n\n### Industry IDs\nProperties that include the suffix _Number_ or _Code_  (e.g. policyNumber, carrierCode, accountNumber) refer to identifiers that are _already exposed_ to agents and policyowners as part of doing business in the Life and Annuity industry. \nThese are identifiers that may show up on policy documents, commission statements, etc. such as a policy number, or agent employee ID number.\n\n## Handling Change\nOur Edge APIs will evolve over time. Future updates of this API may add new endpoints, parameters, or fields. In order to keep older clients working, the behavior and return values of APIs with given parameter values will not change without advance notice.\n\nFor example, you should not consider a Policy object invalid if it contains additional fields besides those currently documented below.\n\n# About Downloads\nCurrently, we provide a single endpoint for downloading large objects (i.e. binary data such as pdfs). This endpoint is named [/puddle/documents/{documentID}](#/paths/~1puddle~1documents~1%7BdocumentID%7D/get).\n\nWe expect any future download endpoints to follow this same naming convention:  _/resourceName/{resourceNameID}_\n\n\n# About Reads\nReads are GETs that return a complete array of structured data for a given type of resource (subject to the user’s authorization).\n\nRead endpoints follow the naming pattern _/puddle/pluralnoun_, where the plural noun describes the type of resource being retrieved. For example, /puddle/policies retrieves all policy data that the requester has permission to view.\n\n## Bulk Payloads \nCoreCONNECT rapidly responds with a bulk payload of all data the user is authorized to view. In some scenarios this may be a large amount of data (e.g. for agents who have access to a large downline book of business). It is important to consider this when architecting a client over these APIs.\n\nEdge API responses can be further filtered based on various parameters described in the subsections below.\n\n## Filtering Payloads\n> **NOTE**: The parameters described in these sections ONLY filter the data the user is already authorized to view. \n> They will _never_ allow the user to see additional or unauthorized data.\n\n### Filtering on Persona (REQUIRED)\nSureify currently distinguishes between two personas: agents and policyowners. The `persona` query parameter filters the API responses based on the desired persona. This becomes important in situations where a single logged in user has multiple personas (e.g. a person who is both an agent and a policy owner).\n\nPolicy servicing portals (like LifetimeSERVICE) make API requests with the `persona=policyowner` filter. This ensures that only the personal policies of the user are presented. Similarly, an agent portal (like LifetimeAGENT) makes API requests with the `persona=agent` filter.\n\n### Filtering on Keycard (OPTIONAL)\nBy default, the Edge APIs return the data associated with all the keycards that the user is authorized to use. However, implementors have the option to use the `keycard` query parameter to filter response data by a single keycard. We do not support the ability to filter by multiple keycards at the same time.\n\nFiltering on a single keycard enables clients to implement an experience similar to impersonation, allowing a head producer or home office user to selectively view the data associated with just a single downline agent. Likewise, it enables clients to implement an experience that allows users to view data associated with only one of their agent/contract identifiers.\n\n## Snapshots Data Elements  \nThe Read Edge APIs include data structures called 'Snapshots'. These structures are named according to the pattern *elementSnapshot* (e.g. `productSnapshot`, `policySnapshot`, etc). \n\nSnapshots represent the state of a particular data element (e.g. a product, a contact, a policy etc) at a particular moment in time. Snapshots always have exactly the same data schema as the endpoint they correspond to.\n\nFor example, a `productSnapshot` has exactly the same schema as the `/products` endpoint. The difference is that a `productSnapshot` represents a particular product at a particular moment in time, while the /products endpoint returns an array of current products.\n\nSnapshots ensure schema consistency, even when dealing with historical data that was not designed to fit into the present-day schema.\n\nFor example, a historical life insurance product that is no longer sold might be referenced on a policy. There are values for the productName and productCode. However, values for many other fields include present-day products (e.g. product type, linked documents, attributes) simply do not exist in this historical product record. Therefore, we only populate the fields in `productSnapshot` that we have data for. In this case, that means populating the productName and productCode fields with the values we have and leaving the rest empty. By providing the entire schema of the `products` endpoint to every snapshot, we give carriers the option to retain any historical values they like, while providing normalized data structures across our APIs.\n\nBelow is a complete list of data elements exposed as snapshots in our Read Edge API: \n\n**<u>Snapshot Data Elements List</u>**\n\n- `productSnapshot` (/cases & /policies endpoints)\n- `policySnapshot` (/commissions endpoint)\n- `payee` (/commissions & /commissionStatements endpoints)\n- `writingAgent` (/commissions endpoint)\n- `client` (/commissions endpoint)\n- `proposedClient` (/quotes endpoint)\n"

It returns records that satisfy this entire combination of filters.\n  - NOTE: This is how you build complex, nested queries. For example, you can create a structure like `(condition1 AND condition2) OR (condition3 AND condition4)`.\n\n- **Search Filter**: Returns records based on whether the data in a given field matches the user-specified search terms.
